<- Vector ----------------------------------------------------------------------
The Vector class handles x, y, z coordinates, w is optional, which is 
homogenous coordinate, what is always = 0.0 and is not using in calculations in
this class.

The contructor expects array of 'dest' and 'orig', last is optional.
They represent two points of vector, and had to be objects of Vertex class.
												(See more in Vertex.doc.txt)

The class has methods: 

Float magnitude(): returns the vector’s length (or "norm").

Vector normalize(): returns a normalized version of the vector.
	If the vector is already normalized, returns a fresh copy of the vector.

Vector add( Vector $rhs ): returns the sum vector of both vectors.

Vector sub( Vector $rhs ): returns the difference vector of both vectors.

Vector opposite(): returns the opposite vector.

Vector scalarProduct( $k ): returns the multiplication of the vector 
														with a scalar.

float dotProduct( Vector $rhs ): returns the scalar multiplication of 
																both vectors.

float cos( Vector $rhs ): returns the angle’s Appendix cosine between
																both vectors.

Vector crossProduct( Vector $rhs ): returns the cross multiplication
		 of both vectors (right-hand mark!).

The class provide reading assessors for its attributes,
please use __get method for this use.
